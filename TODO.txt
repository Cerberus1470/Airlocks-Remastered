Unnamed configuration tool
- Can right-click any airlocks block and modify certain attributes
  - Canvas:
    - Not sure yet... Perhaps corner model?
  - Console
    - Pressure to pressurize until?
  - Door
    - Not sure
  - Walkway
    - Lighting

Config file

      - Time
    - Door
      - Animated open/close
    - Walkway
      - How many particles

Complete Airlock
- Concept to package an airlock to use with a bigger console inside the space base. Details below.
- Possibly a tool to select each part of the airlock, capturing block positions and saving them.

Control Console
- Console to control airlocks throughout the base.
- Can be connected by canvas or wirelessly.
  - Canvas could be easy, but also could be difficult/ugly
  - Wireless would be from the tool (unnamed config tool or a different tool)
- Collects and saves complete airlocks to control:
  - Pressurize at will.
  - Lock/close doors
  - Turn on walkway lights

Neighbor changed
- Implement proper protocols for updating by neighbor change (mainly for the consoles)

Airlock Console
X - Animated texture 0% -> 100% for the console
> - Link to Canvas.
- GUI interface?
- Add Pressure Unstable.

Canvas
> - Proprietary inter-device intra-airlock connection system
> - Canvas corner blocks
- Dyed Canvas! 4 White Canvas in a diamond with a dye in the middle.

Walkways
> - Lighting
> - Activation via console?
- Flip model

Doors
X - 1x2, 2x2, variable like a painting.
  - Rejected, the 2x2 will be its own block.
- Animated model? Probably not.
- 2x2 circular like in the Martian spaceships
  - Sliding/Rotational
  - Frame/door crafted separately?

Poster
- Main visual - Complete airlock
- Little visuals - Each and every part.
- Text: Background accompanying main visual, tiny texts for each part of the small visuals.

Airlock Ideas
-	Console
    o	Integrates with the canvas and operates things also connected to the canvas.
    o	Should update other consoles also connected to the canvas
-	Canvas Block
    o	The main frame of the airlock, connecting everything up and making an enclosed space.
    o	Almost acts as redstone, connecting the airlock components up.
-	Automatic Door sizing
    o	Similar to paintings, but only detecting 1x2 and 2x2.
    o	Upgrade later?
    o	Start with 1x2.
-	Walkway
    o	Completely different block
    o	Emits light out of certain directions?
    o	Emits smoke particles
-	Corner Canvas Block:
    o	Completely separate Corner Canvas block (easy)
    o	Detection using Canvas block placing (hard)
